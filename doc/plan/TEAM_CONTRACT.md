# Team Contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * Be timely and committed to our assign work in the project.
 * Help each other and respect each others' ideas.
 * Do our best work on design and ask for help if it is needed.

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * Approach one another on the broken promises to discuss solutions to the issue
 * Communicate with one another about the issue
 * Be open with one another about the problem without judgement

### Team Procedures:
 * We will meet at least once a week over Zoom to discuss design, and communicate over text while coding.
 * We will try to have our individual work done by Sunday night so that we can integrate our components together on Monday.
 * We will go to office hours together if necessary for help.
 * We will communicate fairly regularly about the project.
